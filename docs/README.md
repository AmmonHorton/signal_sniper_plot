Signal Sniper Plot is an open source plotting tool for use with cpp or python projects. Its pirmary objective is to provide fast and versatile plotting for real-time dsp application debugging.

## Dependencies

Before building the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- **GoogleTest**: Unit testing framework
- **CMake**: Build system
- **Pybind11**: C++ bindings for Python

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) file.

## Building and Installing

### Using Setup Scripts

1. **Setup Debug Environment**:
   Run the `setup_debug_env.sh` script to create a virtual environment, install Python dependencies, and build the project with testing and Pybind11 enabled.
   ```
   ./scripts/setup_debug_env.sh
   ```

2. **Source the Environment**:
   Source the `env.sh` script to expose the `mkf` and `mk_clean` aliases for building and cleaning the project.
   ```
   source scripts/env.sh
   ```

3. **Build and Install**:
   Use the `mkf` alias to build and install the project.
   ```
   mkf
   ```

4. **Clean the Build**:
   Use the `mk_clean` alias to clean the build and remove the virtual environment.
   ```
   mk_clean
   ```

### Manual CMake Build

If you prefer to run CMake manually, you can use the following flags to customize the build:

- `ENABLE_TESTS`: Enable GoogleTest unit tests (default: OFF)
- `ENABLE_PYBIND`: Enable Pybind11 Python bindings (default: OFF)
- `BUILD_RPM`: Build an RPM package (default: OFF)
- `BUILD_DEB`: Build a Debian package (default: OFF)
